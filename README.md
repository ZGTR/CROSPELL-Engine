# CROSPELL-Engine

<strong>Breif</strong>
<br/>This is a simple engine I did back in 2012 containing most of the simple Natural Language Processing, NLP, algorithms, methods and approaches + WPF UI.

<strong>The Naming</strong>
<br/>From Correction + Spell = CROSPELL.

<strong>What's in here</strong>
<br/>The following <i>things</i> are implemented:
<ol>
<li/>Auto-correction
<li/>Language Identification
<li/>Word Prediction: The corpus are not included due to size. Add your favorite corpus and the system will work just fine.
<li/>Topic Prediction: The corpus are not included due to size. Add your favorite corpus and the system will work just fine.
<li/>Dictionary
<li/>Image Processing using NLP
<li/>ISRI and Porter Stemming Algorithms
<li/>Genome Matching using Minimum Edit Distance
<li/>Sentiment Analysis
</ol>


<strong>Nice Perks</strong>
<br/>Some of the algorithms are applied outside the NLP scope. For instance you can find the MED algorithm applied for image matching. Though it's not applicable at all in reallife (change in color or orientation will wreck the matching), it was nice to <i>experiement</i>.

<strong>UI</strong>
<br/>There's WPF application attached with the library. You can test and try different things directly from the UI.
